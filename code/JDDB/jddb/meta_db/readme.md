    label_list : List. The queried label names.  
    need_nd : Bool. Whether to divide the returned shots into disruption shots and non-disruption shots, and return the disruption shots and non-disruption shots. The default is False, and only the list of shots available for all diagnostics is returned; When need_nd=True, the list of shots available for all diagnostics, as well as a list of non-disruption shots and a list of disruption shots are returned.  
    show : Bool. Whether to display statistical results. The default is True, which displays the number of shots available for each given diagnostic in the given shot number list, the number of shots available for all given diagnostic signals, and the number of non-disruption and disruption shots. If show=False, don't displayed.    
  **Return:**  
    When need_nd=False, only return one list, which is the list of shots available for all given diagnostic signals.  
    When need_nd=True, return three lists, which are the list of shots available for all given diagnostic signals, list of non-disruption shots, and list of disruption shots.  
  **Example :**  
    ```python
    shot_list = [shot for shot in range(1064000, 10666489)]

    db.count_label(shot_list, labels)
    ```
    Show:

    Returns a list of shots available for all given diagnosis, a list of non-disruption shots, and a list of disruption shots.  
    ```python
    CompleteShots, NormalShots, DisruptShots = db.count_label(shot_list, labels, need_nd=True, show=False)
    ```
